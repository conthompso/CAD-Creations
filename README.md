# CAD-Creations

The AllParts folder contains parts for my senior year CAD project. There is another file 
within AllParts that contains the individual parts as well as the assembly files.


B24_Wing_Model is the rough model that I created in AutoCAD that contains the airfoil profile as well as the stringer configuration. This is a 
quick model I created for the purposes of displaying the stringer configuration on the B-24 Bomber.


The CurvedPaddle and Straight Paddle files are paddles that I created by adapting a previous rough model from another group of students. These models were
used for the purpose of importing into altair to do fluid analysis to determine the drag on both paddles to determine which paddle is "better" for the
purposes of my senior design project.
